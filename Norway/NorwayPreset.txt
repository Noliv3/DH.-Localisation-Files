FARMING~~~FARMING
GREENHOUSE UNLOCK DESC~~~Speed up your farm's growing speed by 25% with the addition of a greenhouse.
FARMING UNLOCK DESC~~~Grow various strains of grass on a hydroponic platform to add agricultural resources to your supply chain.
WATERWORKS~~~WATERWORKS
WATERWORKS UNLOCK DESC~~~Upgrade the capabilities/speed of various machines in your colony by connecting them to your water system.
CARGO ROCKET~~~CARGO ROCKET
ROCKET UNLOCK DESC~~~Launch freight rockets filled with crates to sell your resources in the galactic market. Due to high offworld demand, resources sold by rockets grant a weight/revenue bonus of 30%.
OIL DERRICK UNLOCK DESC~~~Pump that valuable black liquid out of the ground by constructing this machine.
TRAIN UNLOCK DESC~~~Connect to this planet's underground railroad network, and bring freight trains through your colony as a highly efficient method to sell your resources. Rather than receiving crates, freight trains receive resources via loader silos. These silos can be loaded via minecart.
REFINER UNLOCK DESC~~~Refine your light weight ores into (heavier) refined resources using the refiner. Also construct a factory, which the refiner and many other machines must be built inside of. The Refiner both inputs and outputs crates.
STEP CONVEYOR UNLOCK DESC~~~Evenly and efficiently allocate crates between factory-based machines by using a step-conveyor system. You can also incorporate transfer-claws into your system to move crates between separate conveyors. Transfer tubes can even connect to passing crates on a step conveyor.
REMOTE CONNECTOR UNLOCK DESC~~~Use this device to remotely connect to a container from a potentially distant location within a shared factory. The remote connector especially comes in handy when dealing with large combiner systems.
COMBINER UNLOCK DESC~~~Combine refined resources together into (much heavier) combined resources by implementing this factory machine into your supply chain. Rather than receiving crates, the combiner inputs/outputs resources via transfer tube ports.
CLAWTRAIN CRATE GATE UNLOCK DESC~~~Use this device to block a clawtrain from passing through a given stretch of track until it has either picked up or dropped off a specific threshold of crates.
CLAWTRAIN TRUCK LOADER UNLOCK DESC~~~Load trucks directly with clawtrains using this special clawtrack structure. Just build one right on top of a road's pitstop and connect your claw track.
CLAW TRAIN UNLOCK DESC~~~Efficiently transport crates all around your colony using this inverted rail track system of grabber-claws. Just like drones, clawtrains can drop-off or pick-up crates from load/unload stations.
